For most of the cities, the estimates for odds ratio(OR) are below 1.0(1.0 are not included in their 95% CI). So, comparing to white victims for those cities, there is significantly lower estimated odds of solving homicides among non-white victims. The CI for some cities (such as Boston,MA) are narrow, so be can be more confident in future predictions to these cities.
